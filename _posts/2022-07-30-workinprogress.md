For those who don't know me, which I'm assuming is almost everyone reading this blog post, I'm <br>
Surya Somayyajula, and I am a rising sophomore, well technically junior, computer science major <br>
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As a freshman, I was excited to experience all that <br>
Wisconsin had to offer. Particularly, I enjoyed the computer science coursework quite a bit, <br>
to my surprise, as I had found my computer science coursework in high school to be quite dry. <br>
Anyways, I was excited to apply the skills I had learned to projects outside of my schoolwork, <br>
such as a language interpreter. Moreover, I wanted to work at a company as an intern during the <br>
summer, as I believed that I could level up my programming skills and gain a head start compared <br>
to my freshman peers.

I set out to gain an internship by the end of my freshman year. The journey did not go quite as planned. <br>
I first wrote my resume, sort of, well completely, overstating my coding abilities and embellishing my <br>
previous projects and work, which in hindsight, I probably shouldn't have done, well, to the extent I had <br>
done. I then started to apply to many companies over my fall semester. I also attended my school's career <br>
where my friend and I were completely bewildered by the upperclassman with their internship experience, and <br>
well, their coding skills. I personally tried the fake it till you make it approach, in which I embellished my <br>
skills to recruiters, which actually did work to a certain extent, because I did have some base knowledge in <br>
the first place. Anyways, I received 2 interview offers after applying to 40 companies fall semester, and one <br>
interviewer never responded back to me and the other was a recorded interview that went nowhere. <br>

It was expected, but disappointing, as I had seen many students receive internship offers during the fall semester. <br>
I was wondering if I was smart enough, or did I not have enough experience (I quickly realized it was the latter). <br>
Anyways, spring semester I applied to another 40 companies, with the same resume, and essentially <br>
had no outcome except for one program: IRIS-HEP. I happened to receive a career outreach email from my school, and <br>
I saw that IRIS-HEP was accepting research interns for the summer. I thought I may as well just give it a shot, and <br>
see what happens. To my surpise, I actually got to the next stage of writing a research proposal with my current mentor <br>
Vassil Vassilev. I wrote a research proposal on how I was going to improve the packaging tool for Cling, a C++ interpreter <br>
that is used by the CERN institute and other C++ developers. And one day in April, my proposal was accepted, and I was to start <br>
working on the project in late May. I was very happy and surprised that I had such luck, knowing that I really didn't have <br>
much to offer companies. 

Anyways, now I have worked for the Compiler Research Group through the IRIS-HEP program for the past 2.5 months, and I have <br>
learned a lot about open source development and compiler infrastructure. I definitely made many mistakes along the way, but <br>
my mentor and other open source contributers guided me along the way and I feel that I have really grown as a developer.  <br>
It's hard to believe I had trouble with Git just a mere 2 months ago! I've also learned a lot of low level packaging and OS details <br>
that I think will aid me as a compiler and general developer in the future. And recently, I have become a top 15 contributer for the Cling <br>
project! I am looking forward to working with the Compiler Research Group in the future! <br>

As you've most likely expected, I'm going to list some takeaways that I think would benefit any student applying for internships. <br>
Don't clutter your resume, and for the love of god, don't make it longer than a page, and if you are, you're probably listing
too many things. Also, try not to overstate or embellish your achievements too much, because that can actually mess up your chances. <br>
Recruiters can tell if you're BSing them or not. Also, don't put a skill you have absolutely no experience in, because an interviewer <br>
will likely check if you actually know your stuff. And there's the usual Leetcode grinding and CTCI that'll prepare you for interviews. <br>
You should also browse around and ask people about previous interview experiences, it obviously won't be the same, but it will give you <br>
an idea of what to expect. Well that's about all I can think of for now because I just wrote this whole thing at 3am, but remember, just <br>
keep applying and fine tuning your application and leveling up your skills at your own pace, and you should be fine, because I had basically <br>
no hope, and look at me now!

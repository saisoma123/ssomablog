title:  "80 applications, 1 offer"
---
For those who don't know me, which I'm assuming is almost everyone reading this blog post, I'm 
Surya Somayyajula, and I am a rising sophomore, well technically junior, computer science major 
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As a freshman, I was excited to experience all that 
Wisconsin had to offer. Particularly, I enjoyed the computer science coursework quite a bit, 
to my surprise, as I had found my computer science coursework in high school to be quite dry. 
Anyways, I was excited to apply the skills I had learned to projects outside of my schoolwork, 
such as a language interpreter. Moreover, I wanted to work at a company as an intern during the 
summer, as I believed that I could level up my programming skills and gain a head start compared 
to my freshman peers.

I set out to gain an internship by the end of my freshman year. The journey did not go quite as planned. 
I first wrote my resume, sort of, well completely, overstating my coding abilities and embellishing my 
previous projects and work, which in hindsight, I probably shouldn't have done, well, to the extent I had 
done. I then started to apply to many companies over my fall semester. I also attended my school's career 
where my friend and I were completely bewildered by the upperclassman with their internship experience, and 
well, their coding skills. I personally tried the fake it till you make it approach, in which I embellished my 
skills to recruiters, which actually did work to a certain extent, because I did have some base knowledge in 
the first place. Anyways, I received 2 interview offers after applying to 40 companies fall semester, and one 
interviewer never responded back to me and the other was a recorded interview that went nowhere. 

It was expected, but disappointing, as I had seen many students receive internship offers during the fall semester. 
I was wondering if I was smart enough, or did I not have enough experience (I quickly realized it was the latter). 
Anyways, spring semester I applied to another 40 companies, with the same resume, and essentially 
had no outcome except for one program: IRIS-HEP. I happened to receive a career outreach email from my school, and 
I saw that IRIS-HEP was accepting research interns for the summer. I thought I may as well just give it a shot, and 
see what happens. To my surpise, I actually got to the next stage of writing a research proposal with my current mentor 
Vassil Vassilev. I wrote a research proposal on how I was going to improve the packaging tool for Cling, a C++ interpreter 
that is used by the CERN institute and other C++ developers. And one day in April, my proposal was accepted, and I was to start 
working on the project in late May. I was very happy and surprised that I had such luck, knowing that I really didn't have 
much to offer companies. 

Anyways, now I have worked for the Compiler Research Group through the IRIS-HEP program for the past 2.5 months, and I have 
learned a lot about open source development and compiler infrastructure. I definitely made many mistakes along the way, but 
my mentor and other open source contributers guided me along the way and I feel that I have really grown as a developer.  
It's hard to believe I had trouble with Git just a mere 2 months ago! I've also learned a lot of low level packaging and OS details 
that I think will aid me as a compiler and general developer in the future. And recently, I have become a top 15 contributer for the Cling 
project! I am looking forward to working with the Compiler Research Group in the future! 

As you've most likely expected, I'm going to list some takeaways that I think would benefit any student  applying for internships
Don't clutter your resume, and for the love of god, don't make it longer than a page, and if you are, you're probably listing
too many things. Also, try not to overstate or embellish your achievements too much, because that can actually mess up your chances. 
Recruiters can tell if you're BSing them or not. Also, don't put a skill you have absolutely no experience in, because an interviewer 
will likely check if you actually know your stuff. And there's the usual Leetcode grinding and CTCI that'll prepare you for interviews. 
You should also browse around and ask people about previous interview experiences, it obviously won't be the same, but it will give you 
an idea of what to expect. Well that's about all I can think of for now because I just wrote this whole thing at 3am, but remember, just 
keep applying and fine tuning your application and leveling up your skills at your own pace, and you should be fine, because I had basically 
no hope, and look at me now!
